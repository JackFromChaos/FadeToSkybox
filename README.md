This Repo is Deprecated! Use KinoFog!
-------------------------------------

This repository was used for experimental purposes, andÂ its fade-to-skybox functionality has
been merged to [KinoFog](https://github.com/keijiro/KinoFog). I've stopped updating this
repository, and thus it's recommended to use KinoFog instead of this when you need its functionality.

FedeToSkybox - Description
--------------------------

A variant of the global fog shader, which fades to a skybox instead of a constant color.
